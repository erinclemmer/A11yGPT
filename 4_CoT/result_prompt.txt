You will return the line that has a problem, say what the problem is, and generate html that will fix the problem.
You will only return valid JSON according to this schema:
{
	"problem_type": "", // Short description
	"offending_line": "", // one or more lines with the problem
	"fixed_line": "" // Fixed line or lines
}
If no error is found write "NONE" in the problem type property.
