It can also disrupt users who may need more time to read content due to disabilities or other factors.\n\nStep 3: Suggest a Solution\nInstead of using meta refresh to automatically refresh the page, consider providing a manual option for users to refresh the content. This can be done by including a \"Refresh\" button or link that users can activate when they choose to update the page content.\n\nIn this case, the line `<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0\">` should be removed to improve accessibility and provide a better user experience."
