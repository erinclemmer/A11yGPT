Identify the specific area of concern: In this case, the issue is the use of meta refresh with a time-out, which automatically refreshes the page after a set period of time. \n\n2. Understand the impact on accessibility: Meta refresh with time-outs can be problematic for users with disabilities, especially those using screen readers or assistive technologies. Automatic page refreshes can disrupt the user's ability to navigate and access content, potentially causing confusion or difficulty in interacting with the website.\n\n3. Locate the meta refresh tag: Look for the meta refresh tag within the HTML code of the website. The meta refresh tag typically includes attributes such as 'http-equiv=\"refresh\"' and 'content=\"0\"', which trigger the automatic page refresh.\n\n4. Consider alternatives: Instead of using a meta refresh with a time-out, consider implementing user-controlled mechanisms for page refreshes. Providing users with the ability to manually trigger a page refresh or navigate to updated content can enhance accessibility and user experience.\n\n5. Modify the code: Once you have identified the meta refresh tag, you can either remove it entirely or replace it with a user-triggered refresh option. Update the code accordingly to ensure that the website no longer relies on automatic page refreshes.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively address the accessibility issue related to the use of meta refresh with a time-out on the website."
