These tags should be replaced with semantic HTML elements or styled using CSS.\n\n3. **Replace with appropriate elements**: Replace `<b>` with `<strong>`, `<i>` with `<em>`, and `<font>` with CSS styling or appropriate semantic elements depending on the context of the text.\n\n4. **Test the changes**: After making the replacements, test the website to ensure the text is still styled as intended and the content remains accessible to users with disabilities.\n\nLet's start by examining the HTML code for any usage of `<b>`, `<i>`, or `<font>` tags."
