Identify interactive elements: Look for elements like buttons, forms, links, and any script-triggered events that require user interaction.\n2. Check for onmousedown event: Ensure that if an element has an `onmousedown` event listener associated with it, there should also be an equivalent `onkeydown` event for keyboard accessibility.\n3. Verify keyboard access: Test navigating through the page using the Tab key to see if all interactive elements are reachable and usable without a mouse.\n4. Check for focus styles: Make sure that there are visible focus styles for keyboard users to see which element is currently focused on.\n5. Test with screen reader: Use a screen reader to navigate through the page and check if all interactive elements are announced correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, we can identify if there are any missing keyboard accessibility features or if any elements are inaccessible to users who rely on keyboard navigation."

Ensure that all <input>, <img>, <br>, <hr>, <source>, and <button> elements are self-closed if they don't have any content inside.\n\n3. Confirm that all elements with id attributes have unique values. Check for duplicate id values in the elements with ids such as \"browse\", \"video\", and \"create-playlist\".\n\nBy following these steps and carefully reviewing the HTML code, we can identify any accessibility issues related to incomplete start and end tags or non-unique id attributes."
