Address input: does not have an associated label with the \"for\" attribute properly pointing to \"address\".

The issue is that the \"for\" attribute of the label for the Address input is pointing to \"address\", but the \"alt\" attribute is used instead of the \"for\" attribute.\n\nTo fix this accessibility issue, the label for the Address input should use the \"for\" attribute instead of the \"alt\" attribute:\n```html\n<label for=\"address\">Address:</label>\n```\n\nThis change will ensure that each input element has only one associated label, resolving the issue where an input element has more than one associated label."
