Check each element in the HTML to ensure that they have complete start and end tags. This means that each opening tag has a corresponding closing tag, and all attributes are properly enclosed in quotes.\n\n2. Verify that each id attribute within the document is unique. The id attribute is meant to uniquely identify an element within the document, so it should not be repeated for multiple elements.\n\nLet's go through the HTML provided and identify any issues related to incomplete tags or duplicate id attributes."
